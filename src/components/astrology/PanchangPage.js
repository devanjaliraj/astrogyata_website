                                    <p>

                                        Panchang is an astrological calendar that is based on the position of celestial bodies such as the Sun, Moon, and planets. It is used to determine auspicious times for various events, such as weddings, travel, and starting new ventures. The panchang also provides information on important festivals and fasting dates, as well as the phases of the moon and other astronomical phenomena. With the help of panchnag, a person can choose to start or accomplish a particular task after studying the favorable planets ruling the particular task. It is a belief among people that doing task(s) as per panchang timings brings good fortune and helps in the completion of the tasks with ease. Our online panchang software developed in consultation of our astrologers to get maximum benefits.
